      <description>Watching Mages and Murderdads - Planescape Torment
A fun show, pointing out as they begin Planescape Torment how much it and its setting owe to the work of Gene Wolfe, specifically The Book of The New Sun, but I think Latro in the Mist would be another apt touchstone.

      <description>The Iliad I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to The Iliad, specifically the Penguin Classics Rieu translation. Excellent stuff, all the tropes of action films, embedded deep at the start of the Greek tradition. Brings back memories of classical studies in secondary school.
I listened to Elizabeth Vandiver&amp;rsquo;s The Iliad of Homer course from The Great Courses, which was short and excellent.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Architecture diagrams should be code
Discoverable docs are a problem with as many answers as there are people thinking about it, this one seems good if you&amp;rsquo;re not already committed to other tools.</description>

      <description>The below was originally written for and published on the Cohort company blog, Oct 6, 2017.
Dr. Eoin Hurrell leads Data at Cohort. Here, he reflects on what’s involved in designing a system to ingest and analyze massive volumes of public data, to make predictions on relationships, and things people are knowledgable on.
Cohort helps you find the people you need, through the people you already know and trust. It sounds simple, but the experience of existing social search is much closer to “I am looking to follow/connect with a person on this site”.</description>

      <description>Beginning with work year with a hackathon An excuse to further my Rust learning, and work with a couple of engineers who know more than me on the topic, I learned a lot. Types provide so much, it would be unwise to forget their power and place (felt rusty after years away!)
Some links I found helpful:
