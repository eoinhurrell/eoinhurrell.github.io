      <description>Reading Gene Wolfe Was Sci-Fi’s Most Enigmatic Writer
Always good to read about Wolfe and the slight renaissance his work is seeing.
Interesting to learn Wolfe&amp;rsquo;s papers are in Northern Illinois University
2022 State of the Tools
I&amp;rsquo;ll frequently read about how other people set up their work, just to learn about tools people find useful.
I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten about mosh, glad to see it seeing use.

      <description>Reading ChatGPT Isn&amp;rsquo;t a Great Leap Forward, It&amp;rsquo;s an Expensive Deal With the Devil Programming AIs Worry Me How To&amp;hellip; Use ChatGPT to Boost Your Writing Chatbots Are Not a Good Replacement for Search Engines
A lot of chatGPT reading this week, a lot of experts understandably skeptical, or worse, missing its flaws and being overly impressed. Chat continues to be a poor search interface though.</description>

      <description>Reading Blueprints for Recommender System Architectures: 10th Anniversary Edition
A lot to take from this, Amatriain has both assembled architectures from industry leaders and revisited his own work at some of the biggest recsys companies in the world.
Real-Time Semantic Search Demo
I&amp;rsquo;ve built a few systems like this, it&amp;rsquo;s great to see they are getting easier to build.
All Programming Philosophies Are About State
All code is data, I&amp;rsquo;m sure of it.</description>

      <description>Watching Tár (2022) - An excellent film
Reading The Open Secret of Google Search &amp;amp; https://twitter.com/alex_buraks/status/1618988134850785280
Reading a bit about search as Yandex&amp;rsquo;s source code was leaked. Interesting to get some insight into what factors are considered for ranking, age of links is a novel one.
Two Hunters by Astrid Anne Rose
A short horror story I thought was pretty good, some strong imagery.

      <description>Watching Mages and Murderdads - Planescape Torment
A fun show, pointing out as they begin Planescape Torment how much it and its setting owe to the work of Gene Wolfe, specifically The Book of The New Sun, but I think Latro in the Mist would be another apt touchstone.
Reading Predictions Scorecard, 2023 January 01
Rodney Brooks continues to bring sobering facts to much-hyped discussion.
The Dangers of Over-Engineering
Thinking a lot about simplification and connecting engineering priorities and business priorities.</description>

      <description>The Iliad I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to The Iliad, specifically the Penguin Classics Rieu translation. Excellent stuff, all the tropes of action films, embedded deep at the start of the Greek tradition. Brings back memories of classical studies in secondary school.
I listened to Elizabeth Vandiver&amp;rsquo;s The Iliad of Homer course from The Great Courses, which was short and excellent.
Things I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Architecture diagrams should be code
Discoverable docs are a problem with as many answers as there are people thinking about it, this one seems good if you&amp;rsquo;re not already committed to other tools.</description>

      <description>Beginning with work year with a hackathon An excuse to further my Rust learning, and work with a couple of engineers who know more than me on the topic, I learned a lot. Types provide so much, it would be unwise to forget their power and place (felt rusty after years away!)
Some links I found helpful:
