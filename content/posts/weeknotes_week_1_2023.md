## Beginning with work year with a hackathon {#beginning-with-work-year-with-a-hackathon}

An excuse to further my Rust learning, and work with a couple of engineers who
know more than me on the topic, I learned a lot. Types provide so much, it would
be unwise to forget their power and place (felt rusty after years away!)
