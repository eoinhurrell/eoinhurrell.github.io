## The Iliad {#the-iliad}

I've been listening to The Iliad, specifically the [Penguin Classics](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Iliad-Audiobook/0241440920) Rieu
translation. Excellent stuff, all the tropes of action films, embedded deep at
the start of the Greek tradition. Brings back memories of classical studies in
secondary school.

I listened to Elizabeth Vandiver's [The Iliad of Homer](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Iliad-of-Homer-Audiobook/B00DCX3LGM) course from The Great
Courses, which was short and excellent.

Watched the first episode of The Last of Us, very close to the videogame, well made.
