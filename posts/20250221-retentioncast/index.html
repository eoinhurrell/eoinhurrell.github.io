The Churn Problem
If you&rsquo;ve worked in e-commerce or SaaS, you know customer churn is the silent killer of growth. Traditional approaches to churn prediction often involve batch processing - running models overnight on yesterday&rsquo;s data. But by the time you&rsquo;ve identified that a customer is at risk, they might already be gone."><meta name=author content="Eoin H"><link rel=canonical href=https://www.eoinhurrell.com/posts/20250221-retentioncast/><meta name=google-site-verification content="G-CJ2ZWR4583"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://www.eoinhurrell.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://www.eoinhurrell.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://www.eoinhurrell.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://www.eoinhurrell.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://www.eoinhurrell.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://www.eoinhurrell.com/posts/20250221-retentioncast/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.eoinhurrell.com/posts/20250221-retentioncast/"><meta property="og:title" content="RetentionCast: Building Real-Time Churn Prediction with Change Data Capture"><meta property="og:description" content="TL;DR This is a quick write-up of RetentionCast, a system I built to predict customer churn in real-time using Change Data Capture.

The system processes live transaction data through Kafka and Debezium to calculate churn probability and Customer Lifetime Value. Check out the GitHub repo\nThe Churn Problem If you’ve worked in e-commerce or SaaS, you know customer churn is the silent killer of growth. Traditional approaches to churn prediction often involve batch processing - running models overnight on yesterday’s data. But by the time you’ve identified that a customer is at risk, they might already be gone.\nSome companies model churn as “if we haven’t seen them in X days they’ve churned”. This is a poor model because it neglects the customer’s actual usage of the system. If a user who visits every day hasn’t been seen in three days they could be gone. This has always bugged me. The data to identify churn risk often exists in your system the moment a customer takes (or doesn’t take) certain actions. What if you could catch these signals the moment they happen? A better way to look at churn is to use more complex models like the ‘Buy Til You Die’ models, that can project likelihood of churn for each user forward in time (i.e. if we haven’t seen this person in three days they would have a 60% chance of having churned).\nI was a big fan of lifetimes, a Python package for analyzing purchase behavior and predicting customer lifetime value, before it was archived. Its spiritual successor PyMC-Marketing has incorporated much of its functionality, but I wanted to go deeper on the underlying algorithms.\nRetentionCast gave me an excuse to reimplement some of these models from scratch, but with a twist - making them work in a streaming context rather than batch.\nReal-Time with Change Data Capture Change Data Capture (CDC) is one of those powerful patterns that isn’t discussed enough. The premise is simple: instead of querying your database for changes, you tap directly into the transaction log and stream out changes as they happen.\nIt’s getting much easier to build these types of streaming architectures. In previous work when setting up real-time analytics pipelines, it was both exciting and frustrating because the tooling wasn’t there and you had to build basically every piece yourself. Now with tools like Debezium and Kafka, the heavy lifting is handled for you.\nHere’s how RetentionCast’s architecture works:\nAs transactions happen in the e-commerce system, they’re written to Postgres Debezium captures these changes directly from Postgres’s transaction logs These changes are streamed to Kafka topics A consumer service processes each event to update an analytics table with key metrics The Analytics Table The heart of the system is surprisingly simple - a single table with these fields:\nfirst_purchase_date: When the customer first converted last_purchase_date: When the customer made their most recent purchase frequency: Number of repeat purchases total_order_value avg_order_value From these basic metrics, we can derive powerful insights about customer behavior patterns and churn likelihood. For this project I store retention_campaign_target_date, the date at which the user’s likelihood to still be alive falls below 70%, i.e. a good time to add them to a win-back campaign to retain them. The trick is keeping this table updated in real-time as transactions flow through the system.\nWhy This Approach Works Churn modelling is usually performed in batch, i.e. a batch operations looks at all users and predicts “who is at risk now”, using this to select users to target. RetentionCast is designed to calculate when a user is likely to churn as they are checking out, using survival analysis to have a more nuanced take on churn.\nRetentionCast strikes a balance by:\nProcessing each transaction as it happens Updating key customer metrics immediately Making those metrics available for real-time prediction The result is a system that can tell you, at any moment, which customers are showing early warning signs of churn - when there’s still time to intervene.\nThe Trade-offs of Real-Time It’s worth noting the downsides of this approach. As Dan McKinley famously wrote, “Whom the Gods Would Destroy, They First Give Real-time Analytics”. Real-time systems are:\nMore complex to operate than batch systems Potentially more difficult to debug and fix in production A trade-off that only makes sense at scale or for critical business functions What’s Next? RetentionCast is still a work in progress. I’ve got plans to:\nAdd more sophisticated churn prediction models, i.e. different churn models for different segments of the user base. Build visualization dashboards for monitoring Benchmark performance at different scales If you’re interested in exploring this further, check out the GitHub repo. I’d love feedback, especially from folks who’ve tackled similar problems in production environments.\n","wordCount":"789","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-02-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-02-21T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Eoin H"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.eoinhurrell.com/posts/20250221-retentioncast/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.eoinhurrell.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.eoinhurrell.com/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">RetentionCast: Building Real-Time Churn Prediction with Change Data Capture</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-02-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 21, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Eoin H</div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=tldr>TL;DR<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tldr>#</a></h2><p>This is a quick write-up of RetentionCast, a system I built to predict customer churn in real-time using Change Data Capture.
